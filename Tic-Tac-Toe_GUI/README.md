# Tic-Tac-Toe
This program was created to use the GUI feature to play tic-tac-toe. 
- GUI (Graphic User Interface)
- RGB feature to access the background for the GUI (color scheme)
- image needed to display "X" on the game board since there is no function supported to fill a shape of a cross, but will not be required for "O" as it has an fill oval function
- graphics data type used for customization of GUI
- set restrictions/optimizations for tic-tac-toe game
